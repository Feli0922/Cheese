# Day4 Writing

### Common App 课外活动
1. 40%-60%都跟CS相关：
- 打了四年的NOIP信息学竞赛（高二上学期就退役了，没参加省选和NOI国赛），同时在USACO、Codeforces、CodeChef等Competitive Programming网站打比赛（通宵的好借口）。
- 参加了[英才计划](http://ycjh.org/)计算机学科的科研项目。

以下的CS活动也和教育有关，是crosslisted：
- 在校内信竟团队聊一聊自己也一知半解的算法或者[新学的公开课](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?)，以为看了[MIT OCW](https://ocw-origin.odl.mit.edu/)（一个神奇的网站）和[CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)就能控制好氛围，结果经常是响彻全校的大笑声。
- 发起天津地区第一个[CoderDojo](https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/cn/tianjin/tianjin-nanjing-rd)编程社团，面向所有人开放，去年是唯一的Mentor，今年有位老师帮忙，最后选择了[CODE.org](https://code.org/)作为主要学习平台，因为学生年龄范围在6-13岁，并且对编程的接触有多有少。
- 学了[Gamification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamification)和[Go Beyond Gamification with Gameful Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/leading-change-go-beyond-gamification-with-gameful-learning-2)之后，设计了“Go Gameful”（起个名字是真难）编程课程。

2. 然后是Volunteer Translator:
- 我最喜欢的网站是可汗学院，所以从去年10月开始（为什么没有早点开始呢？虽然从初二就开始在可汗上玩，但是一直害怕自己没有经验不够qualified，然后有个describe your ideal weekend in your native language的问题不知道怎么回答，直到被同样充满教育理想的外教鼓励，同时走出了自闭，去填了申请），每周会花4-6个小时翻译、校对各种学科的文章和练习，我们的进度从去年开始，在非常优秀的advocate带领下突飞猛进，可以在[eEasy](https://eeasy.org)申请加入我们。
- 其他一些我比较喜欢的网站也经常需要翻译志愿者，比如Raspberry Pi（最近在帮他们出中文翻译规则，希望能有大佬指导）、CODE.org、Coursera（热(C)门(S)课的翻译需要抢，文史课的重任没人扛）。

3. 最后校内活动还是挤进去了，看上去有diversity和leadership：
- 在口语社搞一搞活动，比如英文演讲比赛和莎剧排练（说不定以后会入theater坑，之前做过剧院的口译志愿者，感觉不错）。
- 学生会的活动，只在UC的申请文书里写了，不过从初中就开始做技术支持很欢乐，放个Prezi、修个电脑、玩个AE、剪个视频什么的看上去很炫酷，尽管oier（信竟选手）是不学这些的，所以每次干活都是从来没试过就敢接。


——————这里是后申请季分割线——————
- 后申请季和同学做了天文学字幕组，非常业余，可以[移步b站围观](https://space.bilibili.com/411965616/)。
- 偶然间发现了[Amara](https://amara.org/)这个字幕平台，我觉得Mission很棒，可以加入很多有趣的字幕组，比如[艺术类的arte](https://amara.org/teams/arte/)、著名的TED、Scientific American、Github、Mozilla等等，领域很广。虽然以前没试过，但用来练英语听力估计是很好玩的工具，因为很多视频需要志愿者提供英文的transcipt，即使有些听不太清也没关系，还会有其他志愿者帮忙听写和校对。
- 在b站搬运AP课程，一个合集很容易30h+，人工加字幕太累了，所以在开发一个自动生成双语字幕的东西（之前立的flag是暑假结束之前能肝出来）。
- 太多(lan)了写不下了。



### UC 课外活动

CommonApp 10个确实写不下（听说今年加到了20个），UC的每类别的5个还好一些（今年好像也取消了每类活动5个的限制，可以任意类别写20个），可以把一些non-paid的经历写进work experience（只有这项没填满），志愿者活动也可以展开，在Khan Academy、Duolingo、Coursera/edX学习都可以具体写时间和commitment。申请时对于UC的活动列表还比较满意，每次看都充满了动力，感觉日常的积累和数据的记录都值了。
UC的EC对比Common App中的活动列表，其实还差了一个学生会，但是在关于Leadership的Personal Insight文书里又写了相关经历。

##### Other Academic History - Additional Comments:

	In high school, I was selected into our school's STEM innovative and experimental classes. Our STEM coursework (Math, Physics, Chemistry and Biology) is accelerated: we cover the 3-year Chinese curriculum in 1.5 years. In 10th grade, I was allowed to take my Math, Biology and Chemistry classes with juniors and seniors. I am currently auditing college-level mathematics and English classes at Tianjin University Harper International Institute, and I am enrolled in Introduction to Computer Science(ICS3U) for credit.
	
##### Personal Insight Questions
###### Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.
	At 10 p.m. on a Friday night, only one classroom on campus was still brightly lit. Inside, three students were poring over last-minute details for the charity bazaar. Together, we confirmed poster designs, double-checked gift cards, and went over the schedule one last time. We hoped that our hard work would raise money and gifts to help babies diagnosed with biliary atresia.

	Two days later, we arrived at Tianjin First Central Hospital with a bag of envelopes and gifts. A baby with yellowing skin was fast asleep in her mother's arms. We tiptoed towards them, trying not to disturb the little one. When we handed the mother the envelope, filled with love and compassion from complete strangers, tears welled up in her eyes. She kept whispering "thank you." In the next room, other babies fighting the disease were surrounded by new friends we had given them: fluffy ponies and teddy bears. 

	As Vice President of the Student Union, I organize and help execute events like the charity bazaar. As a leader, I challenge myself to try new approaches, take initiative, and volunteer for tasks when no one else does. In this role, I lead a core team to organize events and provide support for 540 high school juniors. I also get to wear a variety of hats: coordinator, host of major school events, graphic designer, student representative, tech master and editor. Engaging in such a wide range of activities has taught me the key to creating effective teams is to match volunteers up with jobs that suit them best. Rather than push people into positions they aren't comfortable with, I find tasks that align with each person's unique skills, ideas, and capacities. I have also tried out every job myself so I know what I'm asking people to do. This way, when they encounter difficulties, I can offer meaningful support and encouragement. 

	Leadership enables me to take positive impact and unprecedented collaboration beyond the walls of a single classroom to empower every student in my school with a chance to contribute. 

######Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.
	I've never had a problem speaking in front of large crowds. Rather, my challenge has been resisting the urge to burst out laughing. I've managed to get around this by trying to make my audiences smile instead of myself, through the use of interesting anecdotes. 

	When I gave an impromptu speech comparing living in the city versus the countryside at Queensland Cup, I acted out my daily life in city on stage, pretending to play volleyball and dashing to my Sunday coding classes. When I spoke about climate change, I opened with: "Meet my friend Torron. He lives near the Tianjin Port, and I got to know him by playing a location-based game called Ingress." I then went on to talk about the impacts of rising sea levels on Torron's home (that with a 3 degrees rise in global temperature, his home would be completed submerged), to show that climate change affects people in tangible ways. When I spoke during my campaign for student union president, I explained the importance of listening to one another. I told the true story of the time when one of the "biggest blunders of my life" so far inspired my teammate to come up with an optimized algorithm. It brought the house down.

	When I include these offbeat stories, audience members' faces gradually turn from bewilderment to knowing smiles. I'm not done yet, though - I always end every speech with a punch line. If I know I'm working towards a humorous moment, I have to resist the urge to laugh myself. 

	Over the years, I've come to love sharing my stories and experiences with others. Public speaking allows me to express myself, share my opinions, and bring new insights to my audiences. It also lets me showcase a more creative, performative side of my personality. Usually, that's good enough for at least a few laughs.

######Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.
	I've been enthralled by computers since childhood. Computer science appeals to my problem solving nature because there's always a new exciting challenge on the horizon.

	Over the past five years, I've taken more than ten "Introduction to Computer Science" courses at school and online, and I've been honored to participate in a plethora of extracurricular CS programs. I was one of five high school students in Tianjin selected for the Experimental Science and Innovation Talent program. Through this program, I conducted research at Nankai University on computer vision projects like seam carving, hybrid images, and image rectification. One of our projects won the top award at the 2017 Machine Learning Reverse Challenge.

	I decided to join a coding circle to develop my programming skills. As part of the group, our professor gave us all problems and then encouraged us to devise our own methods for solving them. We would then share our ideas with one another, brainstorm other potential solutions, and settle on an optimized algorithm. I grew to love collaborating with peers. I felt continually inspired by our community, which gave me the confidence to try new, daring solutions. My exploration into the computer world echoes the motto of Khan Lab School, "Everyone's a teacher. Everyone's a student."

	As a result, to me computer science has gradually become about more than acquiring new knowledge. I see it as an outlet for joining learning communities and engaging new learners. Through my experiences, I have learned one-on-one instruction and pair programming work wonders for teaching students their first Scratch program; similarly, I benefit from open source platforms that connect me to thousands of students aspiring to study machine learning. Computer science brings people together from around the world and I'm thrilled to be part of a learning community which encourages collaboration and sharing. 

	Computer science challenges me intellectually because it's always evolving. It forces me to continually improve as a problem solver and innovator. More importantly, computer science has real world application. By pursuing this field, I have the power to change the world for the better.

######What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?
	As an avid coder, I wanted to share my passion with others. Envisioning informal sessions where I would teach people beginner-level coding and computer science, I decided to found the first CoderDojo coding circle in my hometown. 

	The night of my first lesson, the weather was terrible, but I was relieved to see a packed house. Attendees ranged from fifth graders to high school sophomores to parents, and everyone was excited to learn this new skill.

	Over time, participants became regular members and our conversations became familiar. We would update each other on our lives and share our latest passions or discoveries with the group. I was struck with how diverse we were- in backgrounds, age and gender and I wondered if there was a way to incorporate these elements into our coding curriculum. I decided to try. One participant was drawn to world history, so I weaved in Chinese culture. For this, I drew connections between computer code and 5000-year-old Han characters. Another person was fascinated with great ancient Chinese inventions, so I featured printing technologies in one of our sessions. Soon we began exploring history, culture, art history and other fields. Our weekly coding sessions transformed into engaging conversations and learning opportunities for me and my fellow members. 

	Before founding this coding circle, I viewed coding primarily as a single and individual endeavor that I wanted to encourage others to take up. However, in facilitating and experiencing these sessions, I have come to believe that coding does not need to be a solo pursuit neither is it an end in itself. It is a tool that allows for possibilities of learning and intellectual expansion. And it becomes an increasingly effective tool, the more people shape its direction and use. Ultimately, through code, I developed new forms of meaningful and interactive education that helped me create a close-knit community-not only of coders but of learners. 

	I no longer aim to teach code, but in fact, aim to teach through code, building communities wherever I go.



####Amherst College
* Academic Interests: Computer Science, Sociology, Linguistics
* Please briefly elaborate on an extracurricular activity or work experience of particular significance to you. (Maximum: 175 words)

	> Every time I interpret, I can't help moving my hands. I try not to look at my notes or stumble over my words—purpose and creativity clash with uncertainty and naivete as I practice my art. 

	> I have transitioned from doing written translation of my favorite English websites that aren’t available in Chinese to aural translation at events. Simultaneous interpreting needs to be free and natural to make sense to an audience in real-time. I would like to think I'm connecting communities, one word at a time.

	> What happens when a word hasn’t been translated before? 

	> That's when translation requires some archeological work from me. The idea of "gameful learning," an idea I am still struggling to put into modern Chinese, may well be hidden in a colloquial phrase or even a single Chinese character. It both hasn't been discovered yet, and also could have existed for hundreds of years—and the only way I’d know is to explore.

	> Translation helps me convey ideas and messages I discover along my journey, bringing together those around me.

	> Most of my favorite websites are only available in English and not accessible to Chinese speakers. This is a problem I can do something about. This is why I started translating. 

	> I quickly learned how to navigate through translation portals like Crowdin, learning as I did that every word I translate carries my purpose and creativity, along with my uncertainty and naivety. I started to learn that translation is itself an art.

	> And what if this word hasn’t been translated before? That's when translation involves some archeological work. The idea of "gameful learning," an idea I am still struggling to put into modern Chinese, may well be hidden in a colloquial phrase or even a single Chinese character.

* Why are you drawn to the area(s) of study you indicated earlier in this application? (You may share with us a skill or concept that you found challenging and rewarding to learn, or any experiences beyond course work that may have broadened your interest.) (250 word limit)

	> I am a Climber; thriving on forbidden parts of the Wall, staying away from the stairs and established ladders, I scale with grappling hook and bare hands. Seeing the world I have ascended from as I climb day after day, I am struck by the monochrome grey behind me. This is my secret. By day, I put on the drab greys and push and process towards the Wall, angling for the gates. But during my nights, when all else is silent, I steal away and up, and up. On the other side—Ethics of Memory through edX/BrownX, open source projects through GitHub, all-night hackathons, competitive programming to Ingress mosaic art on Trello. 

	> I have an idea. It’s been germinating for years now—ever since I first learned to climb the Great Firewall that "protects" Chinese netizens. Its pull motivates me in my silent rebellion, in my explorations along the Wall’s abandoned sections and secret passages: I want to bring my people with me to the Other Side, to the Open Ground. 

	> Brown’s open curriculum redefined higher education, yet the new gaokao "reform" in China still limits students’ choices to strictly designated majors of study in college. Why does this system exist? How do we change it? Does it want to be changed?

	> Computer science, philosophy, art history... at Brown I can learn unimpeded, inspired by my peers. I want to study these areas to be able to fundamentally redefine my country's educational system and create a generation of global learners. 

#####Courses/Hack @ Brown
* What do you hope to experience at Brown through the Open Curriculum, and what do you hope to contribute to the Brown community? (250 word limit)

	> Ever since I learned how to use the Internet, I've planned every hiking trip with my family. I got to decide which mountain to explore, which path to take and when would be the best to witness the beauty of nature. This is how I see a Brown education.

	> When I get to a fork, do I go left or right? Data, Ethics and Society, or Sound and Symbols? CS for Social Change or Mind, Brain and Behavior? When I hike, things never go exactly as planned. After I spot another hidden path not marked on the map or rare-for-city-dwellers species of flora and fauna, I lead my group onward. Choosing different courses and concentrations may lead me to the same path, the path I’ve always walked or never explored. Either way, it is my own path of new adventures. The gems "hidden" in Courses@Brown have yet to be fully discovered with recommendations from my peers. Developing new understandings of "openness" together, I shall seek inspiration from innovative and supportive communities like Hack@Brown, undergraduate teaching assistant groups, and Women in Computer Science.

	> A Brown education will empower me to imagine and implement bold ideas with an open source ethos. It will allow me the freedom to explore paths known and unknown, encouraging me to build intentional, intuitive, and even serendipitous connections over these next four years. 

#####Home & Community
* Tell us about the place, or places, you call home. These can be physical places where you have lived, or a community or group that is important to you. (250 word limit)

	> The night of my CoderDojo’s first lesson, the weather was terrible, but I was relieved to see a packed house. Attendees ranged from fifth graders to high school sophomores—even the parents were excited to learn this new skill.

	> Over time, as our group became closer, conversation branched out from just coding. I was struck by our diversity—age, gender and background. I decided to try to incorporate these elements into our coding curriculum. One participant was drawn to history, so I weaved in Chinese culture, drawing connections between computer code and 3000-year-old Chinese characters. Another person was fascinated with great ancient Chinese inventions, so I featured printing technologies in one of our sessions. Soon we began exploring history, culture, art history and other fields. Our weekly coding sessions transformed into engaging conversations and learning opportunities for me and my fellow members. 

	> Before establishing this coding circle, I viewed coding primarily as a single and individual endeavor that I wanted to encourage others to take up. However, in facilitating and experiencing these sessions, I have come to believe that coding can be a tool to facilitate learning and intellectual expansion. And the more people who participate, the more effective it becomes. Ultimately, through code, I developed new forms of meaningful and interactive education that helped me create a close-knit community—not only of coders but of learners. 

	> I no longer aim to teach code, but in fact, aim to teach through code, building communities wherever I go.

And yet, there are those who love it!” As you seek admission to the Class of 2023, what aspects of the College’s program, community or campus environment attract your interest? (100 word limit)

	> I love reading People Places Pines and imagining my own custom D-Plan. It’s like my peer mentors at Dartmouth are recommending transformative experiences to try out! I want to put Alexis’s motto, "Come to learn, return to serve," on my motivation wall. Kate adapted one section of Don Quijote into a performance piece for her final, which sounds exactly like something I'd do.

	**Free Penn Online Non-Credit Course (Coursera)**
	感觉UPenn对于自己的网课还比较重视，目前还有一个CS的研究生文凭项目[Master of Computer and Information Technology](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/mcit-penn)，学费是$26,300，时长20-40个月，不是很清楚现在这种100% Online Master's Degree 甚至是Bachelor's Degree到底认可度如何。介绍说是

	> The only online Ivy League master’s degree in Computer Science designed for students without a Computer Science background.

	除了Online Degree，在Coursera还能搜到130多门UPenn开的课，很多是商科和工科的**职业导向**课程，我上过的其实也有Greek and Roman Mythology、古埃及历史、柏拉图哲学等等；可能是因为上过很多学校的网课，写附加文书很顺利（就是以Gamification这门课开头），强调了在线平台与校园经历的很多不同，列举了在学校想学的几门CIS课，网页上搜到的Urban Education minor也很喜欢，接着又写了Penn Emerging Scholars Program (PESP) 和五六个校园组织和活动，最后表明自己想做一个“renaissance engineer”。

	UPenn和Cornell都是可以写650词的 Why Essay，同时都是要选择学院和**仅**一个专业，in some way体现了学校Pre-professional的一面。对比一下UPenn的CS只有在工院有，Cornell的CS在文理和工院都有，课程设置还有一些差别。

	Name, if known
		Gamification, Social Impact Strategy...

* Why School + Why Major
	The first online course I took was Gamification from Penn in the summer of 2016. Ever since then, if I see a free online course from Penn, I enroll without hesitation, knowing it will be a challenging yet exciting adventure into uncharted territories. While I value the experience of taking those courses, I feel their main benefit is to give me solid footing for proactively engaging and contributing to a live classroom dynamic. For example, after finishing the 10-week version of Greek and Roman Mythology on Coursera, I would love to have brought up "xenia", the ancient Greek concept of hospitality in an in-class discussion, asking my classmates whether they think it is related to the first line of the Analects of Confucius and hospitality in Chinese cultures. It is only through in-person interaction that we can truly speak to each other’s hearts. That’s why I desire a bricks-and-mortar classroom and above all, a vibrant "offline" learning community. Penn, with its expansive curriculum and blend of the academic with the practical, is the perfect such community. 

	While Penn has extensively expanded learning access through multiple initiatives including MOOCs, which have transformed my learning experience, of course there are countless courses and learning communities only accessible to Penn students. I look forward to taking CIS 106 - Visualizing the Past, where I will be able to combine my interests in ancient civilizations and UNESCO World Heritage sites with computer science using the latest modeling visualization programs. CIS 541 - Embedded Software for Life-Critical Applications will also be a rewarding learning experience for me. One seminar I hosted on Gamification featured Lifesaver, a game-in-a-film which introduced our students to the choices they would have to make in a real emergency. CIS 541 will help me gain a better understanding of computer architecture that can save lives. More importantly, each in-person course I take at Penn will be a brand-new learning experience which I hope to bring to a wider audience eager to learn more and connect their passions, either through sharing my own stories of my education or building intimate learning communities. By taking the thought-provoking courses and seminars in the urban education minor offered in conjunction with Penn's Graduate School of Education, I can start designing the framework for my dream: creating an organic learning platform that will inspire love for learning.

	As an aspiring computer scientist and peer leader, I hope to participate in the Penn Emerging Scholars Program (PESP) and work in small groups with like-minded peers. I’m excited to join a learning experience that resembles that of my own coding circle—we meet every week and inspire love for interdisciplinary computer science education, just like PESP. Through PESP, I desire to explore and experiment with new forms of meaningful and interactive education that has helped me create a close-knit community—not only of coders but of learners. In addition, there are a wide array of academic student groups, research opportunities and learning communities at Penn I wish to be involved in—Advancing Women in Engineering, CIS Undergraduate Summer Research Program, becoming a Penn Tutor, the Dining Philosophers, Undergraduate Chair's Advisory Board, just to name a few.

	I look forward to continuing my academic exploration at Penn. Along the way, I will continue to gravitate towards becoming a "renaissance engineer," configuring visual settings of aerial robots, "understanding classroom interaction," and exploring both the ancient philosophy of Plato and education reform in a vibrant learning community.


#####Info Session in Beijing (with Brown)
在Info Session的对比下，就知道自己更喜欢UPenn了。还去过的info session有UChicago，虽然拿了一堆周边（可赠UCLA和Chicago的），但是并没有打算申请。如果算上高二申高中项目的info session，还得加上Phillips Academy Andover（这是我的梦校，最喜欢“Non Sibi”(not for self)这个motto，之前说的“佛系无梦校”指的是大学申请）和United World College（去过常熟校区的Selection Day 后被圈粉，经常给安利低年级的同学，真的是"be your true self"，如果是个coder/geek那就大大方方地说出来，不需要刻意迎合学校的“type”）。对于小众（并不）学校的info session，给招生官留下印象**可能**还比较重要，比如Andover在入场时就和老师开心地聊起了学校“need-blind”的政策（之前看宣传片经常激动流泪），正式的介绍结束后，又去找了招生官提了学校网站的bug（不知道当时是怎么想的），然后他告诉我Andover的网站马上就要更新了（[更新后的网站](https://www.andover.edu/)真好看）。包括在正式开始前和UWC的校长介绍了自己坐火车从天津来特地参加招生会，他就表示了他刚去过秦皇岛，大家都不问问题，希望我可以多问点问题哈哈哈。最后Andover是wl（现在依然是梦校，如果有gap year的话，想申请读post-graduate一年），UWC录的是Costa Rica校区（真的没想到，因为11年级直接申IBDP比较难，前几年据说是个位数录取，而且Selection Day感觉很多小组活动也没有很突出，面试的三位校友问的问题也不是很容易，上来一句日语的问候我直接忽略了，心态有点崩，但毕竟有语数外的笔试，估计同时会参考笔试成绩吧），虽然最后没去。（有趣的一件事：哈佛第二次面试的其中一位校友就是UWC的联合创始人，太巧了哈哈哈，果然就谈起了为什么没有去UWC，后来还把这个问题写进了Additional Info里面。）

对文理学院感兴趣的朋友们不要错过每年8月份举办的LAC Tour(non-profit)，都是文理学院的招生官代表学校进行宣讲，同时还有机会进行面试和参加工坊。
