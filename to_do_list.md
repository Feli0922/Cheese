> I met a few sophomores at the local Cornell alum event, and we had great fun talking with each other. We also added friends online and comment on each other's posts from time to time. Getting to know Cornellians in my local area enables me to ask questions, learn about their experiences, and get help or advice.

When I got into college, I was so excited about becoming a student at such a great university. But sometimes I also worried I might be different from other students. And when I got to campus, sometimes it felt like everyone else was right at home, but I wasn't sure if I fit in. At some point, I realized that almost everyone comes to college unsure whether they fit in or not. It's ironic—everybody comes to college and feels they are different from everybody else when, really, in at least some ways we are all pretty similar. Since I realized that, my experience at college has been almost one-hundred percent positive.

I love college and I wouldn't trade my experiences here for anything. I've met some close friends, I've had some fantastic experiences, and I've certainly learned a lot. Still, the transition to college can be difficult, and it was for me. My freshman year sometimes I didn't know what I was doing—I made a lot of casual friends at parties and other places but I avoided interacting with professors in class or going to office hours. I think I was intimidated by them. I also got some low grades early on, which stressed me out. But these things all got better over time. I began to make good friends through classes and labs. And my grades got better as I started working in study groups and asking for help from professors and teaching assistants. I even got involved in research with a professor. Now I am happier than I have ever been at college. It is really rewarding for me to feel like I belong in the intellectual community here.

Compared to other students, I worried that my high school wasn't so good and that maybe my high school classes hadn't prepared me well for college. When I got to campus, to be honest sometimes I thought some of my professors were scary. I thought they were critical and hard in their grading, and I worried about how they and other students would evaluate me. So I didn't speak much in class and I didn't want other people to read my papers. But after a while I began feeling more comfortable. I started to enjoy my classes more and found some close friends I trusted. I also became more comfortable speaking in class, and sometimes I asked my friends to look over my papers for me. And I saw that even when professors are critical, or their grading harsh, it didn't mean they looked down on me or that I didn't belong. It was just their way of motivating high-achieving students.

Initially my transition to college was pretty easy. Hanging out with friends in my dorm was fun, and I met a lot of people early on. After Winter Break, things got harder because it felt like all my really good friends were at home and I didn't have friends like that at school. However, I decided to just give it time and let things fall into place. I got involved in extracurriculars, and I met people who had common interests and unique perspectives. I also got to know people in class as study partners who became close friends. I found a comfort zone by exploring my interests and taking the leap into an active life on campus. But this took time and before I found my niche here there were times when I felt quite lonely.

The summer before freshman year I was so excited about coming to college. But I was anxious too—it's a big transition. For me the most difficult part was coming from a situation in which I knew every student in high school for the past seven years to college where I didn't know one student yet. Once I got here, even though I met large numbers of people, I didn't have a small group of close friends. At first sometimes I felt I had to work to find lab partners and people to be in study groups with. I was pretty homesick, and I had to remind myself that making close friends takes time. But over time, in classes, clubs, and social activities, I have met other people, some of whom are now just as close as my friends in high school were.

As excited as I was to come to college, I must admit that part of me thought that I had been accepted due to a stroke of luck, and that I might not measure up to the other students. Early on, I bombed a test. It was the worst grade I'd ever received, and I felt terrible and isolated. But then, I found out I wasn't the only one. No one did well on that test. It was really hard—the professor was trying to set a high standard. He knew it'd be tough, but he knew that if we worked hard we could get to that level. It wasn't for some time that I believed that I was totally up to par and could really succeed here. But eventually I did, and college started to feel more like home. Though I still have doubts about myself sometimes, I know they're the kinds of things everybody feels on occasion.

I had small, close-knit classes in high school, so sometimes I worried that it would be hard to adjust to large, impersonal lectures in college. I worried I would not have a personal connection with my professors or get help when I needed it. And it did take time to get used to large lectures in college. But eventually I saw that, just because there were more students, the professors didn't care less about me or think of me as just a number. Freshman year, I was struggling with a writing assignment, so I went to office hours to talk with the professor. I showed him a draft and he was excited about the ideas. I mean, it wasn't well written yet but he showed me how I could take it to the next level. I realized that in college sometimes you have to reach out. Not everybody's going to be receptive all the time, but many professors are eager to work with students on subjects they love. Later, I ended up talking with another professor in my major about my interests. That ultimately led me to get involved in some research she was doing. I have just loved working with her and her graduate students outside the formal classroom. It is great to actually participate in cutting edge research!

Before coming to college, I didn't worry much about classes and grades, but freshman year I felt unprepared for the workload and the differences in grading. It was a learning experience. After getting burned grade-wise several times and feeling stressed out in the process, I worried that I wasn't smart enough. Fortunately, a conversation with an upperclassman set me straight—he told me that everyone struggles at first: You have to learn how to study in college. I figured out how to budget my time more wisely, so I wouldn't have a huge crunch at the last second. And maybe even more important, I learned that when I get stuck on a problem or an idea it helps to talk with people—like a TA or professor or someone in my class or even just a friend. Although my start was somewhat rocky, it has felt good to learn from my mistakes, and I am proud of the success I have had.

When I think back to the summer before freshman year, I was incredibly excited about coming to college but I was also somewhat intimidated. Walking into classes for the first time freshman year was uncomfortable, especially small classes. The only thing more intimidating than the other students (some of whom were upperclassmen), were the professors, who were all so highly regarded in their fields. But now I feel much more relaxed. I realized we all bring something to the discussion, a different perspective or new ideas. It can be easy to forget what you bring. And I saw that everybody here has a common goal—to share knowledge and to learn and grow to do cool things in the future. We are all a part of that. Now I feel much more confident participating in discussions, listening, and sharing my opinions.
